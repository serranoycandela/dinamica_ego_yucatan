This chapter examines the methods of comparison and combination of maps in pairs. Probably the single most significant aspect of GIS is the ability to combine spatial data from different sources together. The purpose of making such combinations is to identify and describe spatial associations present in the data, and to use models for analysis and prediction of spatial phenomena. Two-map overlays with some basic arithmetic and Boolean operators are powerful tools for examining the spatial patterns caused by interactions of one map with another. In generating a two-map overlay, the goal is to combine the inputs according to a set of rules that determines, for each location, the class of the output map from the classes of the input maps.}
